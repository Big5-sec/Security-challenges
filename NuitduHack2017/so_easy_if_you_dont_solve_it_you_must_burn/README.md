## Write-up

Several write_ups were already published, like [here](http://techoverflow.fr/2017/06/26/ndh2k17-wargame-write-up-so-easy/) or [here](https://quentin.dufour.io/blog/2017-06-25/write-up-wargame-ndh-xv). Another solution is to print it (or directly use your screen if it permits to do the following) and then look at the sheet with a grazing view (almost 0Â° of angle).
