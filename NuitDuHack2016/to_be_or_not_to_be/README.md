## Challenge description

This challenge is a whitespace crackme. As any crackme, you have to enter the correct password to be able to validate. To solve it, i think it's necessary to get a reinterpretation, in human understandable manner, of the program. One could think of it as a transpiling process.

## Write-up
No competitor has published any write-up for this challenge. I have so published a complete one on my blog [here]() that tries to explain everything from the ground up step by step.
