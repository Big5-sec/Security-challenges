## Challenge description

This challenge is a forensic one, where one needs to find how the network capture is organized in order to decipher the data exchanged. As the title indicates, that network capture is a simulation of a client/server, where data is exchanged as with the Poison Ivy RAT, which is tunneled using gh0st RAT communication model.

## Repository description

* ./
   * client.py -> the client used to make the network capture
   * server.py -> the server used to make the network capture
   * poison_ivy.pcapng -> the network capture, and so the challenge
